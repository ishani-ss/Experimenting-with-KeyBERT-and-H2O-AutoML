    "\n",
    "To conduct KeyBERT processing, the author of KeyBERT advises a specific transformer (“all-MiniLM-L6-v2”) as a sentence transformer (to embed both documents and keywords) for English documents. This transformer has a sequence length limit of 256, therefore long text data needs to be split (preferably into sentences) to fit this sequence limit, before KeyBERT can be run on text. Sequence length here means the number of tokens (words) within the text. In addition, the author of KeyBERT recommends that running KeyBERT on long text is not the use case for KeyBERT, as many different topics will be covered in such long text. For the purposes of this project, text splitting into sentences of variable sentence length, followed by KeyBERT implementation will be carried out. \n",
